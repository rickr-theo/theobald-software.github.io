Please use the *Edit* link to open up an additional dialogue for assigning structure elements as shown in the screenshot.

Similar to pure scalar parameters it also applies to structure elements: Imports can contain constants or variables, exports are only allowed to contain variables. Of course all value fields could be left empty if the parameters are not needed.
