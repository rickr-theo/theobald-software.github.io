Unlike the other components, the Xtract IS BW Loader component is a data destination, not a data source. 

![BWLoader](/img/content/BWLoader.png){:class="img-responsive" }

The BW Loader has always exactly one input pipeline that must be entered within the data flow task. Later on, the elements of the pipeline can be mapped to certain elements of the transfer structure.

The BW Loader components supports 3.x InfoSources as well as 7.x DataSources.
