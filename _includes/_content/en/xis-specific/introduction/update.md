### How do I create a backup?
Just make a copy of all SSIS packages that use Xtract IS.
We recommend that you create a backup at regular intervals so that you can easily switch back to the previous version if necessary or problems occur.
Also remember the product version you are currently using so that you can switch back to the same version in case of an error.
