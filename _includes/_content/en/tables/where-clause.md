### Using WHERE clause 
1. Select and double-click an extraction of type "table" in the main window of the Designer.
The window "Define data source for SAP Table " opens.
2. Navigate to tab **WHERE Clause**.
3. Enter the WHERE clause.
4. To display the results in the **Preview** section, click **[Load live preview]**.

{: .box-note }
**Note:** When fields with the same name exist in different tables, the field names must be formatted as [table name]~[field name], e.g. MAKT~MATNR. This can be the case with [table joins](./table-joins).

### WHERE clause syntax 

{: .box-warning }
**Warning! Extraction fails due to incorrect syntax!** <br>
The extractions fail, if incorrect syntax is used in the WHERE clause. Make sure to use correct SAP OpenSQL syntax. Several important syntax rules are listed in this help section.

{: .box-tip}
**Tip:** To check the syntax of the WHERE clause, click **[Load live preview]**. This way there is no need to run an extraction to see, if the syntax is correct.

#### Syntax rules
- Enter a space before and after the equal sign:<br>
 **Correct:** *YEAR = '1999'* <br>
 **Wrong:** *YEAR= '1999 '*, *YEAR ='1999'* or *YEAR='1999'*

- Set floating point numbers in single quotation mark: <br>
**Correct:** *KMENG > '10.3'* <br>
**Wrong:** *KMENG > 10.3*

{: .box-note }
**Note:** The WHERE clause doesn't need any line break (return key).

- Values must have the internal SAP representation:<br>
  - The date 01.01.1999 has the internal representation 19990101 (YYYYMMDD) 
  - The year period 001.1999 has the internal representation 1999001 (YYYYPPP)
  - Numbers must contain the leading zeros, e.g., customer number 1000 has the internal representation 0000001000.

 Get more information about the OpenSQL syntax on the [SAP help site - Select WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_752_index_htm/7.52/en-US/abapwhere.htm?file=abapwhere.htm) 

### WHERE clause restrictions

{: .box-note }
**Note:** 
When using table joins, restricting the right table of a LEFT OUTER JOIN is only possible starting from SAP Release 7.40, SP05. <br>

If your SAP System is older than Release 7.40, SP05, the following error appears:
*RFC_ERROR_SYSTEM_FAILURE - Illegal access to the right table of a LEFT OUTER JOIN.

Get more information about the changes in Release 7.40, SP05 on the [SAP help site](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-US/index.htm).
