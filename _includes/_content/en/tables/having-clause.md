**Note:** When fields with the same name exist in different tables, the field names must be formatted as [table name]~[field name], e.g., MAKT~MATNR. This can be the case with [table joins](./table-joins).

The aggregate functions from the column selection are only in the HAVING-clause and must be activated accordingly. <br>

With regard to syntax and formulas, the same rules apply as for the [WHERE Clause](./where-clause).
