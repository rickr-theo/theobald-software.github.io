### Hardware Requirements

#### Processor Cores
- Minimum: 2 Cores. 
1 additional core is required for each additional parallel extraction. 

#### Processor Speed   
- Minimum: processor: 1.4 GHz, recommended: 2.0 GHz or faster.

#### Main Memory
- Minimum: 8 GB, recommended: 12 GB for up to two parallel extractions.<br>
4 GB dedicated memory in average for each additional parallel extraction. Check the exact storage requirements of an extraction in your scenario.
<!---Memory consumption depends on many factors including component type (i.e. Table, Extractor or BW Query), number of columns and number of rows in each data package (i.e. package size). <br> 
E.g. the BW Cube component needs for extracting and processing data more main memory space than the Table component for the same data amount. ---->
