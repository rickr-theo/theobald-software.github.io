**The Table Join component is deprecated. Please use the Table component for joining SAP tables.**

The Table Join component allows to join many tables (and views) on the SAP side and to extract the result.  

It is required to install a custom function module on the SAP server to be able to use this component.  

### Manual installation
For a manual installation of the custom function use the setp-by-step guide in our [Knowledgebase article](https://kb.theobald-software.com/sap/installation-of-the-function-module-z_xtract_is_table_join?fromSearch=true). 

### SAP transport
Alternatively you can import the SAP transport file *(thtrans.zip)* that can be found in the ABAP subfolder of the installation folder of our software.
