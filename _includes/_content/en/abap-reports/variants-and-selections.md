After having chosen a report, please assign a variant or a selection parameter. All elements of the selection screen can be found in the table called *Selection Screen*.

If you have a lot of selection parameters, please create a variant in SAP. This is easier to handle than many different single selection parameters.

Use the *Edit* link to fill in a selection.

All kinds of parameters can be edited and entered with the help of the editor.

If the parameter is a complex selection, use the Edit link to open an additional dialogue.<br>
As shown in the screenshot, variables can also be used. Please add an @ right before the value to mark it as an variable.
