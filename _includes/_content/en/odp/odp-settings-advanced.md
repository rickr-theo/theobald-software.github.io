**Package Size**<br>
The extracted data will be split into packages of the defined size. 
If the package size is 0, SAP uses the default ODP Packaging size.
Die default package size is 14400000 bytes.

Make sure that your SAP version includes the necessary notes, see [Technical Prerequisites](../odp#technical-prerequisites). <br>

**Adjust currency decimals**<br>
Use this option when working with currencies/quantities without decimal points e.g., JPY, KRW, etc.
If this option is active all decimal places are maintained after data conversion.

Make sure a currency field is selected for reference.
