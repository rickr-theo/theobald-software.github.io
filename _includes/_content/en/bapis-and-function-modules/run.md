The usage of user-defined variables is possible, as in the following example with the previously defined variable @MaxRows:

![Bapi-Run-Parameters](/img/content/Bapi-Run-Parameters.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The output data of a BAPI extraction can be checked when running an extraction in the browser. 
The following example shows the data of the table ADDRESSDATA, which has the output type *Pipeline*.

![Bapi-Run-Output](/img/content/Bapi-Run-Output.png){:class="img-responsive"}
