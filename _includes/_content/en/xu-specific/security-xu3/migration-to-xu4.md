The migration from XU 2.x and 3.x to XU 4.x can be performed automatically as follows:

### During the installation process
During the installation process by checking the *Convert config files* checkbox. <br>
This calls the *ConfigConverter*, which ensures that all extractions, source systems, destinations, server and user settings from XU 2.x or 3.x are available in the new version. <br>
Fore more information about installation folder files see also section [Installation and Backup](../introduction/installation-and-backup).

### Manually
If the converter is not executed automatically during installation, it can also be started manually from the installation directory. <br>
