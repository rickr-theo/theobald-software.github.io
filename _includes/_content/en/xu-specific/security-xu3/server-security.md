This chapter describes how execution of extractions can be restricted.

The necessary settings can be found via the menu bar - *Server - Settings - Web Server tab*. Select the *HTTPS - Restrict to AD users with Designer read access* radio button to allow extraction execution for specific Windows AD users only. If you require further access restrictions please use an external firewall solution or the like.

Please see also chapter on [Server Settings](../server/server-settings).
