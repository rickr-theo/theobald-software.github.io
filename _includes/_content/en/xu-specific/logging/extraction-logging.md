All Theobald Software products log all steps performed on a system to log files.
The logs can be found in the directory: <br>
e.g.: `C:\Program Files\[Product Name]\logs`

In addition to the extraction logging the [server log](./server-logging) and debug log is saved in the log directory.

To view the extraction log, nagivate to the main window of the designer and click **[Log]**.

Time stamp for each extraction process is displayed at the left part of the "View Extraction Log" window.

When sending an email to the support, make sure to keep the debug details visible to provide as much information as possible.

Both server and extraction logs are automatically deleted after a defined period. The period can be set in the server configuration.
