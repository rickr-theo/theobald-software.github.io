After the parameter mapping, the web service can be deployed and tested. Close the operations dialog, give your web service a name and a title and click on *Deploy*.

After the successful deployment, the service can be tested (i.e. in a REST client). Calling up a web service with a recorded transaction works the same as calling any other web service not using this feature. <br>

Input parameters have to be filled with valid values and a output/result message will be given out in the web service body after the call. For example if a document number was created during the process, it be displayed in the body.
