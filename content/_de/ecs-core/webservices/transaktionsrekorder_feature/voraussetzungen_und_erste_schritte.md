To use the Transaction Recorder feature, the SAP GUI must be installed on the same environment. Furthermore for most transactional processes customizing is necessary in SAP.
To record a transaction, the SAP connection must be defined and working in the WebService Designer.

To get to the feature a new service operation must be created in the designer.

The feature can then be found on the right-hand side in the Activities bar.
