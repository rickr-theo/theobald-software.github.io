The Xtract Universal Server runs as a Windows service with the main process 'C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal\XtractService.exe'. 

*XtractService.exe* starts two listener processes and listens on the following ports by default:

Listener Process| Default Port
------------ | -------------
*XtractWebServer.exe* | 8065 (HTTP) and 8165 (HTTPS)
*XtractConfigServer.exe* | 8064

The server processes use different ports for communication. The web server accepts extraction calls via HTTP(S). 
The configuration server communicates with the Xtract Universal Designer via a dedicated port. <br>

{: .box-warning }
**Warning! Changing the default ports**<br>
After manually adjusting the default ports, the Xtract Universal service does not start.<br>
The stored ports are already assigned and must be adapted in the following config files.<br>
`C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal\config\server\config\general.json`<br>
`C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal\config\server\web\general.json`

If manual adjustments of the port number are necessary, ask your network team for the correct ports.

**Note:** Administrator access rights are required for altering the [config files](./introduction/installation-and-update#program-directory-files).
