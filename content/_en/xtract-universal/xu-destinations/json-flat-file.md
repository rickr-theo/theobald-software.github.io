The JSON flat file destination creates a generic JSON file.

### Adding JSON Flat File Destination
1. In the main window of the Designer, navigate to **[Server] > [Manage Destinations]**. The window "Manage Destinations" opens.
2. Click **[Add]** to add a new destination. The window "Destination Details" opens.
![XU_flatfile_JSON_Destination](/img/content/xu/json/json-flat-destination-det.png){:class="img-responsive"}
3. Select the *Flat File - JSON* destination from the drop-down list.
4. Click **[OK]** to confirm.

### Destination Details
The window "Destination Details" consists of two subsections:
- Name - Extration name
- Type - Extraction type
- File - **Directory** to save JSON flat files
![JSON-Flat-Destination-Details](/img/content/xu/json/json-flat-Destination-Details.png){:class="img-responsive"}

{: .box-note }
**Note:** Filling out the field **Directory** creates a new folder, if it doesn't exist. 

### Checking the extraction result

1. Check the previously defined directory for saving JSON flat files.
2. Open the JSON flat file with an editor of your choice.
