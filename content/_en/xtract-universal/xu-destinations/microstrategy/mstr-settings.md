### Dataset ID

The Dataset ID is set automatically for the default DropAndCreate Update Policy.
For other Update policies it can be set manually.


### Attributes and metrics

Attributes and metrics will be defined automatically based on the data types of the source object. 
If you wish to redefine attributes or metrics click on the correspondent button and then click to generate the JSON definition to modify the definition.
