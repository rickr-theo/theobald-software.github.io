This example depicts an SAP extraction into Snowflake.
**Define extraction**

An extraction is defined based on the SAP table T001W for plants.

**Set destination** <br>
Set the destination connection for the database.

**Preparation** <br>
This way the option *Drop & Create* creates a new table with the name T001W. 
If the table exists already, it will be deleted from the database. <br>
To preview the SQL statement select *Custom SQL* in Preparation, then click *Edit SQL*: a new dialog opens.
In the new dialog select *Drop & Create* and click *Generate Statement*. <br>

Columns will be created using the corresponding data type. 

**Row processing**

The option *Copy data to table* copies the data from the staging layer into the table with the name T001W. <br>
To preview the SQL statement select *Custom SQL* in Row processing, then click *Edit SQL*: a new dialog opens.
In the new dialog select *Copy data to table* and click *Generate Statement*.

The command line can be closed. To check the execution status click *Refresh* in the Designer.
If the extraction is successful, a green icon appears in the status row.
In the given example, 239 data records are loaded into the database.
