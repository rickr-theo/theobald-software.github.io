The data is transferred uncompressed and stored as a csv file.

The data is transferred compressed and stored as a gz file. 

### CSV File Splitting

**No Splitting**<br>
Writes extraction data of a single extraction to a single file in Google Cloud Storage.

**Split**<br>
Writes extraction data of a single extraction to multiple files in Google Cloud Storage. Each filename is appended by *_part[nnn]*. In case of .csv files, the file size is determined by the value set in *Max. CSV file size*.

**Max. CSV file size** <br>
Maximum size of a .csv file stored in the Google Cloud Storage account. 

{: .box-note }
**Note:** The option *Max. CSV file size* does not apply to gzip files. The size of a gzipped file cannot be determined in advance.
