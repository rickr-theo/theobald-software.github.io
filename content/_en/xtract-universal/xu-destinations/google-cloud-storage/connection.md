3. Select the *Google Cloud Storage* destination from the drop-down list.

The window "Destination Details" consists of two tabs:
- GCS Settings
- File Format

### GCS Settings
The tab *GCS Settings* consists of three subsections:
- Connection 
- Bucket
- Encryption

#### Connection
**Client ID**<br>
*Client ID* created in the OAuth 2.0 setup (see [Requirements](./requirements)).

**Client Secret**<br>
*Client Secret* created in the OAuth 2.0 setup.

**Connect**<br>
Processes the previously created OAuth flow to establish a connection with the storage account.
Choose your Google account and grant access to Xtract Universal in all required windows. <br>

{: .box-note }
**Note**: If you did not verify the app, a window with the message "This app isn't verified" is displayed. Click **[Advanced]** and **[Go to Xtract Universal (unsafe)]**. <br>  

When a connection is successful, an "Authentication succeeded" message is displayed in the browser. In Xtract Universal a "Connection established" message is displayed in a separate dialogue. <br>

#### Bucket
The "Bucket" subsection can be filled after a successful connection to the storage account.<br>
**Project ID** <br>
The Project ID can be looked up in the GCP dashboard under *Project info*.

**Bucket name**<br>
Click **[Get buckets]** to display available buckets.

A bucket can be created in the navigation menu under **Storage > Browser**.

![xu-google-cloud-con-05](/img/content/xu/googlecloudstorage/xu-google-cloud-con-05.png){:class="img-responsive"}

You can freely choose the bucket name, the location type and the storage class or access control. 

Under **Advanced Settings (optional)** you can select the desired encryption method applied to the bucket. Get more details on encryption on the official [Google Help Page]https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption).

#### Encryption
**Default** <br>
Applies the encryption method specified in your GCS bucket. <br>
Google encrypts all data that is stored on the Google servers by default. In addition you can use the Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to create and apply keys to your buckets. <br>
The KMS can be enabled in the GCP console's navigation menu under **Security > Cryptographic Keys**.

**Customer-supplied** <br>
If you check the *Customer-supplied* option, you need to provide a valid AES256 Crypto Key (256 bit in length). <br>
The Crypto key is passed to Google to encrypt your data. The key is not stored within the GCP and hence demands the additional effort. Otherwise you wonÂ´t be able to decrypt your data later. <!---ab hier weitermachen-->

**Crypto field** <br>
Depending on the selected encryption method apply the respective cryptographic key here. 

### File Format 
Select the required file format between "Csv", "Json" and "Parquet".

The settings for file type "CSV" correspond to the [Flat File CSV settings](../csv-flat-file).
