### Triggering an extraction from QlikSense

Before copying the Qlik script generated by Xtract Universal to QlikSense, you need to perform the following steps in QlikSense:

1. Create a new Data connection of type REST.
2. Enter the URL of the Xtract Universal Server and port in the URL text box. In the screenshot below, the Xtract Universal server is running on http://localhost:8065/
3. Enter *Xtract_Universal* in the Name text box.

4. Paste the QlikSense script from Xtract Universal into the QlikSense Data load editor.

### QlikSense data load script explained

1. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that usese QlikSense [interpretation functions](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/June2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/InterpretationFunctions/interpretation-functions.htm) *Num#*, *Text*, *Date* and *Time* where applicable. For fields, where an adequate data type can't be determined, no interpretation function is used.

2. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that assigns the field description and the SAP origin of the field as tags to all fields.

3. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that explicitly tags all date field with *$date*. This is to make sure that fields containing a [date before January 1, 1980](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/April2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/date-time-interpretation.htm) are still recognized as date fields in QlikSense.

4. The QlikSense script supports usage of XU [Extraction Parameters](../../advanced-techniques/extraction-parameters).

5. 
    {: .box-note }
**Note**: Don't change the assigned value of variables *xuOriginDateFormat* and *xuOriginTimeFormat*. This is the format how Xtract Universal sends the data of date and time fields to QlikSense. Changing the format will stop the QlikSense script from running.
