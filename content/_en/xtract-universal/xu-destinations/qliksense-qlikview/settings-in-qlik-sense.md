### Triggering an Extraction from QlikSense

Before copying the Qlik script generated by Xtract Universal to QlikSense, perform the following steps in QlikSense:

1. Create a new data connection of type REST.
2. Enter the URL of the Xtract Universal Server and port into the URL text field. In the example below, the Xtract Universal server is running on `http://localhost:8065/`.
3. Enter *Xtract_Universal* into the name text field.

### QlikSense Data Load Script Explanation

1. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that uses QlikSense [interpretation functions](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/June2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/InterpretationFunctions/interpretation-functions.htm) *Num#*, *Text*, *Date* and *Time*, where applicable. For fields, where an adequate data type can't be determined, no interpretation function is used.
2. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that assigns the field description and the SAP origin of the field as tags to all fields.
3. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that explicitly tags all date fields with *$date*. This function assures that fields containing a [date before January 1, 1980](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/April2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/date-time-interpretation.htm) are recognized as date fields in QlikSense.
4. The QlikSense script supports usage of Xtract Universal [Extraction Parameters](../../advanced-techniques/extraction-parameters).

{: .box-note }
**Note**: Don't change the assigned value of variables *xuOriginDateFormat* and *xuOriginTimeFormat*.
 The chosen format enables Xtract Universal to send the data of date and time fields to QlikSense. Changing the format stops the QlikSense script from running.
