### New Installation and Update

{: .box-warning}
**Warning! Data loss:**
System updates or changes can restrict software functionalities and this may lead to data loss. 
Create a backup of the directory: `C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal\config` at regular intervals.

A regular update of the software is crucial for stable performance, especially major changes and high ([H]) priority
updates. Check the version history (https://kb.theobald-software.com/version-history) for updates. A newer version
can be installed over the older version. All settings and created objects are preserved. When migrating data and
settings to another server, follow the instructions described in section [Backup and Migration](./backup-and-migration).

#### Update Preparation

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** Subscribe via [email](mailto:info@theobald-software.com) to Theobald Softwareâ€™s regular newsletter that
informs about changes in the version history and release notes.

1. Check if you have a working test environment with a valid license and maintenance.
2. Make sure that the test environment is a copy of the current productive environment.
3. Check the [Version History](https://kb.theobald-software.com/version-history) and release notes in the
knowledge base to check, if update is needed.
4. Create a [backup](./backup-migration) of the current installation.
5. Conduct any necessary preparations and changes as described in the Release Note / Version History,
especially for major changes and high priority **([H])** update recommendation.

There are two ways of upgrading the product version from XU 2.x and 3.x to XU 4.x:
- Upgrade during installation
- Manual upgrade


### Upgrade During Installation
1. Start the [installation routine](../introduction/installation-and-backup).
2. Make sure to mark the checkbox **Convert config files** checkbox. <br>
The option *Convert config files* starts the *ConfigConverter* application, which ensures that all extractions, source systems, destinations, server and user settings from XU 2.x or 3.x are available in the new version. <br>
Fore more information about installation folder files see also section [Installation and Backup](../introduction/installation-and-backup).

3. Confirm the conversion process in the command line pop-up window.

### Manual Upgrade
If the *ConfigConverter* is not executed automatically during installation, it can also be started manually from the installation directory: ``C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal``. <br>
