### How do I create a backup?
Just make a copy of the complete program directory or at least the config subdirectory (by default under C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal\config) of the machine running the Xtract Universal Server (or Service). The config directory contains all settings, extractions and connections.
We recommend that you create a backup at regular intervals so that you can easily switch back to the previous version if necessary or problems occur.
Also note the product version that you are currently using so that you can switch back to the same version in the case of problems.
