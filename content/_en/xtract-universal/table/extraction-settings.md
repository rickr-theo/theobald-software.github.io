An extraction has two types of settings. The *Extraction Settings* include settings that affect only the respective extraction type, while the *General Settings* are the same for all extraction types and determine common settings. See also [General Settings](../advanced-techniques/general-settings).

### Opening Extraction Settings
Within the window "Define data source for SAP Tables" click **Extraction Settings**. The window "Table Settings" opens.

**Note:** if a technical SAP user does not have authorization rights to access *ENLFDIR* table, a corresponding error appears. After confirming the error message, the user can **still** adjust the extraction settings.
