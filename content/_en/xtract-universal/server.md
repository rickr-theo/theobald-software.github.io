The follwing section contains an overview of the Xtract Universal server.

The server performs two main tasks:

- Run extractions stored in the [Config](./advanced-techniques/backup-and-migration#configuration-files) directory. 
- Make extractions stored in the [Config](./advanced-techniques/backup-and-migration#configuration-files) directory available to the Designer.

### Run Extraction on the Server

Execution is triggered by an HTTP request. The HTTP request can be triggered from the target environment for [pull destinations](./destinations#pull-and-push-destinations) or from the xu command line tool (xu.exe /xu.elf). 

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** The process can be traced in the [Extraction Log](./logging/logging-access-via-designer#extraction-logs).

1. Server checks the authentication and authorization of the request.
2. The target environment is prepared for writing the extracted data (e.g. establish database connection, create file).
3. The license is checked.
4. A connection to the SAP system defined in the source is established.
5. The data of the defined extraction type is requested.
6. Each extracted data package is written to the target environment.
7. After all packages are received, the connection to the SAP system is terminated and the target environment is informed that the extraction is complete.

### Access the Settings using the Designer

1. XtractConfigServer.exe checks the authentication and authorization of the request.
2. Designer requests a certain setting, e.g., list of all extractions. 
3. XtractConfigServer.exe reads the requested settings from the [Config directory](./advanced-techniques/backup-and-migration#configuration-files) and sends these settings to the Designer.
4. The user changes the settings in the Designer (e.g., destination settings).
5. Designer sends the changed settings back to XtractConfigServer.exe. XtractConfigServer.exe saves the changed settings in the [Config directory](./advanced-techniques/backup-and-migration#configuration-files).

### Server Architecture

The server runs as a Windows Service and the main process of the XU Service is XtractService.exe. The Windows Service can be [managed](./server/start-server) via the Windows Services administration or the Task Manager.
Xtractservice.exe starts two listener processes:
- XtractWebServer.exe
- XtractConfigServer.exe

{: .box-tip }
**Tip**: The XtractService.exe logs its actions in ServiceLog.txt 
The log file is located in the logs subdirectory of the program directory: 'C:ProgramFiles\XtractUniversal\logs' (default).


The both listener processes listen on the [Ports](./server/ports) defined in the [Server Settings](./server/server-settings).

XtractConfigServer.exe waits for new connection requests from the designer. 

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** The XtractConfigServer.exe logs its actions in log files. 
The log files are located in the logs subdirectory of the program directory: 'C:ProgramFiles\XtractUniversal\logs\server\config' (default).

XtractWebServer.exe waits for HTTP requests. 

For each TCP connection the XtractWebServer.exe starts a new instance of XtractRun.exe, which processes all HTTP requests coming in over the particular TCP connection.

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** The XtractRun.exe logs its actions in the log subdirectory. 
The log files are located in the logs subdirectory of the program directory:`C:ProgramFiles\XtractUniversal\logs\server\run` (default) 
These are also the logs that can be displayed in the Designer under **[Server]>[Logs (Run)]**.

The following HTTP requests are possible:
- Executing an extraction
- Emptying the result cache of an extraction
- Canceling all runs of an extraction
- REST API requests e.g., [Logs](./logging/logging-access-via-http), [Metadata](./advanced-techniques/metadata-access-via-http) etc.

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** The XtractWebServer.exe logs its actions in log files. 
The log files are located in the logs subdirectory of the program directory: 'C:ProgramFiles\XtractUniversal\logs\server\web' (default).
