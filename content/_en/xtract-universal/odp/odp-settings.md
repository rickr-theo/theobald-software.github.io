The following section gives an overview over the settings that can be changed for the ODP component.
The settings can be changed in the window "Define data source for SAP ODP". 
There are two ways to open the "Define data source for SAP ODP" window:
- Create a new extraction (see [Define an Extraction](../getting-started-xu/define-a-table-extraction) with the Xtract Table component as an example)
- In the main window of the designer, choose an existing ODP extraction and click **[Edit]**.<br/>
