The following steps depict the loading of the extraction into a database - Microsoft SQL Server. 

To load an extraction Microsoft SQL Server destination needs to be created and defined.

### Creating Microsoft SQL Server destination
There are several ways to create a destination. This example depicts 
1. In the main window of the designer, click **[Destination]** to open destination settings.
![Load-Destinations](/img/content/destination_xu.png){:class="img-responsive"}

2. In the window "Destination Settings" click **[...]** (1) to manage destinations. 
![Load-Manage-Shared-Destination](/img/content/destinations_load_manage_shared.png){:class="img-responsive"}

3. Click **[Add]** (2) to add a new destination.

4. Fill in a **Name**, select **SQLServer** from the drop down list **Type** (3).

5. In the section "Connection", fill in the fields **Server Name** and **Database Name**. 
6. Click **[Test Connection]** (4) to check the connection to the  database.

### Loading the extraction into the Microsoft SQL Server database

1. In the main window of the designer, select an extraction with any destination and click **[Destination]**.<br>
![Load-Destinations](/img/content/destination_xu.png){:class="img-responsive"}<br>
The window "Destination Settings" opens.

2. In the "Destination Settings" window, choose your created **SQLServer** destination from the drop down menu. You can change the extraction-specific settings, if needed. In the example, the default settings are kept:
![Load-Shared-Destination-SQLServer](/img/content/sqlserver_destination-settings.png){:class="img-responsive"}

9. Click **[OK]** to get back to the main window of the Designer.       
4. Click **[Run] > [run in xu.exe]**<br>
![Run an extraction](/img/content/run_extraction.png){:class="img-responsive"} <br>
The command line window opens and the successful extraction procedure ends with a message *Extraction finished successfully*.

Open your SQL Management Studio and check the existence of the successfully extracted table.
