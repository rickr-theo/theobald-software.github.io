The following sections describe how Xtract Universal connects with QlikSense or QlikView.

For connection purposes Xtract Universal offers a destination of type *Qlik*. Qlik destination generates a data load script, which needs to be inserted into the data load editor of your Qlik application. Depending on whether you run a QlikSense of QlikView application, Xtract Univeral creates a different data load script.

Running the Qlik application triggers the respective Xtract Universal extraction via the data load script. Xtract Universal sends the extracted SAP data through an http-csv stream directly to your Qlik application.

## Requirements

There are no particular technical prerequisites for using the Qlik destination.

## Generating a Data Load Script

### Displaying the Qlik Data Load Script
1. Run an extraction with a "Qlik" destination. The window "Run Extraction" opens.
![XU_qlik_generate_Script](/img/content/xu/XU_qlik_generate_Script.png){:class="img-responsive"}
2. *Optional (when using QlikSense)*: In the *Parameters* section, mark the check boxes for the parameters which you wish to add as SET variables in the QlikSense script.
3. Click **[Generate Qlik Script]** to generate a data load script. The window "Script" opens.

### Further Processing of the Script
1. Select the *QlikView Script* or *QlikSense Script* tab.
2. Click **[Copy to Clipboard]** to copy the script.
![XU_qlik_generate_Script](/img/content/XU_qlik_generate_Script_2.png){:class="img-responsive"}
3. When using QlikView, paste the copied script into the QlikView data load editor. For QlikSense, see section [Settings in QlikSense](#settings-in-qlik-sense).

**Note:** The "SET methods" cannot be edited in the "Script" window. Edit the SET methods in the Qlik data load editor. 


## Settings in QlikSense

### Triggering an Extraction from QlikSense

Before copying the Qlik script generated by Xtract Universal to QlikSense, perform the following steps in QlikSense:

1. Create a new data connection of type REST. <br>
**Note**: In QlikSense the default value for the *Timeout* is 30 seconds. Increase the timeout to a sufficiently high value if the time till the first data package arrives from SAP is higher than 30 seconds. The maximum input value is 10.000 seconds.

2. Enter the URL of the Xtract Universal Server and port into the URL text field. In the example below, the Xtract Universal server is running on `http://localhost:8065/`.
3. Enter *Xtract_Universal* into the name text field.
![XU_qlik_QlikSense_data_connection](/img/content/XU_qlik_QlikSense_data_connection.png){:class="img-responsive"}

4. Paste the QlikSense script from Xtract Universal into the QlikSense Data load editor.

### QlikSense Data Load Script Explanation

1. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that uses QlikSense [interpretation functions](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/June2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/InterpretationFunctions/interpretation-functions.htm) *Num#*, *Text*, *Date* and *Time*. For fields, where an adequate data type can't be determined, no interpretation function is used.
2. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that assigns the field description and the SAP origin of the field as tags to all fields.
3. Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script that explicitly tags all date fields with *$date*. This function assures that fields containing a [date before January 1, 1980](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/April2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/date-time-interpretation.htm) are recognized as date fields in QlikSense.
4. The QlikSense script supports usage of Xtract Universal [Extraction Parameters](../execute-and-automate-extractions/extraction-parameters). <br>

![XU_qlik_QlikSense_XUParameter_Log2](/img/content/XU_qlik_QlikSense_XUParameter_Log2.png){:class="img-responsive"}

{: .box-note }
**Note:** Do not change the assigned value of variables *xuOriginDateFormat* and *xuOriginTimeFormat*.
The chosen format enables Xtract Universal to send the data of date and time fields to QlikSense. Changing the format stops the QlikSense script from running.


## Migration from Xtract QV

You have Xtract QV installed, have defined your SAP source system(s) and extractions and use them as a datasource in your qlik applications.

If you want to migrate this scenario to Xtract Universal, refer to [info@theobald-software.com](mailto:info@theobald-software.com) or [info@us.theobald-software.com](mailto:info@us.theobald-software.com).
