To extract data into a SharePoint Custom list, you need either your own SharePoint 2013 server or access to a SharePoint Online system as part of Office365.

If your SharePoint server isn't configured for remote access already, go to **Central Administration -> Application Management -> Configure alternate access mappings**  and add an appropriate mapping for the zone "Internet".
