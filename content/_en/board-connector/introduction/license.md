The BOARD Connector will be installed along with a trial license.  To view the details of the license, please go to *help -> info*.

![BOARDConnector_Demo_License](/img/content/BOARDConnector_Demo_License.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Since BOARD Connector version 2.28.0 the license files are delivered as json text files. For updating a license or replacing a trial license with a regular license, just place the json file in the server's application directory (default is C:\Program Files\BOARDConnector). A restart of the BOARD Connector Service is no longer necessary.

Prior to BOARD Connector version 2.28.0 license files were delivered as .dll files. The steps for replacing a license are the same as with json files. However with .dll licenses a restart of the BOARD Connector Service is required.

If you run BOARD Connector client and server on different machines, it's only necessary to replace the license on the server.
The server name is part of the regular license.
