### About licensing concept of BOARD Connector

BOARD Connector is licensed per Windows server responsible for extractions. A demo license is automatically installed with the installation of BOARD Connector. <br>
A regular license is provided after purchasing the product in [My Theobald Software - Portal for Customers and Partners](https://my.theobald-software.com/). The product license is bound to your company and a specific server name.<br>
If you run BOARD Connector Designer and BOARD Connector Server on different machines, it is only necessary to replace the license on the server.
 

### Installing the BOARD Connector license - BOARD ConnectorLicense.json
For installing the regular license, place the regular BOARD ConnectorLicense.json into the following directory of the server: <br>
`C:\Program Files\BOARD Connector`
 <br>
