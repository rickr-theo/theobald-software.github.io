As part of the maintenance, it is guaranteed that BOARD correctly runs as specified in our documentation and with the newest SAP and BOARD versions. 

If you have any technical questions or difficulties you can contact our support by phone or by mail.

Maintenance for six months is included in the license. After that you can buy a yearly maintenance for 20% of the currently valid license price.

The right to update and access to support expires for maintenance that was not extended.
