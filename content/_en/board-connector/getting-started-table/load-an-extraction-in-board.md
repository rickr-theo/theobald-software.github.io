The next step is to load an extraction in BOARD using the data reader. In the BOARD designer we defined the extraction plants, which extract the plants table *T001W* from SAP. In BOARD we defined the entity plants, in which we want to load the SAP data. Now select *Database -> Data Reader -> SAP -> New Protocol*  to create a new protocol.

Now create a new connection for the BOARD Connector Server. Optional you can select an existing connection. Set a *name* and the *URL* of the BOARD Connector server (e.g. localhost:8098). Then click *OK*.

Now you see in the *SAP* tab on the left hand side a list of all exitsting extractions grouped by extraction type. Now select the extraction *plants*.  In the window below you see now the list of all available fields including description and datatype information.

Now select the *MDB*  tab and select the fields *Code* and *Desc*  of the entity *Plants*.
The selected fields will appear in the top region of the form. In the column *Position* map each field of your entity to an SAP field. In the column *Action*  select the corresponding entry.

Now fill in the field *Title* with a name and click *OK*.

Now execute the DataReader to extract the SAP data.

After executing the DataReader you can see in the protocol how many rows have been loaded into the entity.
