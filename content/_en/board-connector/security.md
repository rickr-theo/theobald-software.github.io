An user group can have one of the following rights:

- **Admin rights**: Users of this group have all privileges. Access limitations on extractions will be ignored.
- **Create new extractions**: Members of this group can create or clone extractions. Group members may not perform any admin tasks such as to change server settings, access server logs or manage users and connections.
- **Modify extractions**: Group members may not create or clone extractions but may execute or edit them. Otherwise, this group has the same rights as the group *Create new extractions*.
- **Read extractions**: Group members may not edit extractions but may read their definition. Otherwise, this group has the same rights as the group *Modify extractions*.
