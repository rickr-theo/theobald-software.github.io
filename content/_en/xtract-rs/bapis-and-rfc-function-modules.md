The Xtract RS BAPI data source was developed to access BAPIs and RFC function modules and integrate them in the Reporting Services (from now on we only use the word BAPI but RFC function modules are meant as well).

You can execute any kind of BAPI but it is recommended to have several import parameters and not more than one single export table. Keep this structure in mind when you create your own Z-functions.
