*Azure Service Bus* is a generic cloud-based messaging system that connects applications, services and devices wherever they are. <br>
**Azure Relay** is a service that is based on the service bus and with which it is possible to tunnel on-premise web services through the firewall into the cloud. 

With the help of Azure Service Bus and Azure Relay you can set up a secure system environment, decoupled from your business system with ECS Core and SAP.
Azure Relay connects to a dedicated server via TCP and provides an endpoint that is visible to client applications. This endpoint can be used for data exchange with ECS Core and your SAP system. 
The advantage of such a system architecture is that no ports need to be opened from the cloud to the SAP system installed on-premise. 

Important: To use this functionality, a standard Tier Subscription for Microsoft Azure is required, which is not included in ECS Core.

Setting up *Azure Relay* with ECS Core works as follows:

Start by creating a new relay as a resource in the Azure Management Portal (>*create a resource*).

Note that there are alternative methods to create and manage Azure resources (e.g. with Powershell if you want to automate this process).

Then click on the newly created resource. The connection string required for Azure Relay registration with ECS Core can be found at *SharedAccessPolicies* and *RootManagedShared AccessKey*.
Copy the complete *Primary Connection String* (Endpoint=sb://...).

Go to *Settings>Azure Relay* on the ECS Core Management Site and perform a new registration with *Add Relay Registration*.
Paste the copied connection string into the field and save the entry with *Add Azure Relay Registration*.

Important: After adding a new Azure Relay registration it is mandatory to recycle the ECS Core Application Pools into the IIS. You can do this manually or on the *Management Site* under *Settings>System Operations* with the function *Clear consumer website caches*.

The Azure Management Portal should now list the relay with the registration.
