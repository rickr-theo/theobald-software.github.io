After you have successfully created and tested a web service, you can export it to an OpenAPI definition. OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is an API description format for REST APIs. Various cloud applications such as *Nintex Workflow Cloud* or *Microsoft Flow* support the import of OpenAPI files as custom connectors. <br>
The advantage of this is that such custom connectors are easier to configure than a relatively technical, direct web service call.
