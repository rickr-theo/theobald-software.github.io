After having chosen a report, please assign a variant or selections criteria. All elements of the selection screen can be found in the table called *Selection Screen*.
If you have a lot of selections, please create a variant in SAP. This is easier to handle than many different single selections.
Use the *Edit* link to fill in a selection. The dialog for editing a selection works like the one discussed in the [Query chapter](../query).
