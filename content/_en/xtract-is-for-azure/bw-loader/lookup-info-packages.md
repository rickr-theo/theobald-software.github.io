After having created a valid connection manager, the editor of the component can be opened (double-click). Use the binoculars button to open the search dialogue and look up an InfoPackage. You may also use wildcards ( * ) for your search.

Lookup will find InfoPackages based on either 3.x or 7.x DataSources.
