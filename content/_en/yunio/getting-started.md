The information described in the following section is a prerequisite for all subsequent sections.

### Starting YunIO

1. Make sure that the *YunIO* service is running.

3. The URL pattern to access the YunIO Web UI is `http://[host]:[port]`. Example: `http://localhost:8077`.<br>
	- If the YunIO service runs on a local server, replace `[host]` with *localhost*.
	- If the YunIO service does not run on the same machine as the browser, replace `[host]` with the name of the host on which the service runs.
	- After the installation of YunIO the Web UI is accessible under the default port 8077. Make sure that the port is not blocked by your firewall.
	- You can configure the port under *Settings* in the YunIO Web UI.
