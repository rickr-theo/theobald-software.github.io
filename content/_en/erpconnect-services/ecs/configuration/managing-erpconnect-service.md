**Test Application Proxy**

Select the *Test* link next to the ERPConnect Services Application name to check the connection to the application proxy.
Select the *Test SAP*  link to check the connection to the SAP system.

To run successfully the SAP connection test be sure of the following: 

- the service "Claims to Windows Token Service" must be running (CA -> Manage services on server). 
- the Windows Services "Claims to Windows Token Service" must be running. 
- the farm account and each other tester (e.g. CA admin) must be a member of the local group "WSS_WPG". 

After any changes restart IIS. 


**Version History**


Select the *Version History* link to show a list of product versions and the changes that were introduced.
