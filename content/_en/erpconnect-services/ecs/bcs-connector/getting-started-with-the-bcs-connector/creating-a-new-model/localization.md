You can localize the property names in your model with the BCS Connector. Use the ellipsis button next to a property field to specify a localized value in one or more additional languages.


In the *Localization* dialog, select the *Add* button to specify a localized value.

Select a *Language*, and then enter the localized *Display Name* next to it. You can specify values in multiple languages.

The localized names will be shown to the user on SharePoint sites that are configured for a different display language.
