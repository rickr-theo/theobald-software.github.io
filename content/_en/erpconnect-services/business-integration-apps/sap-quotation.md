With the Business Integration App SAP Quotation, it is possible to create quotations for materials or services in SAP or to use a convenient search function to obtain data already generated from the SAP system. Whereas the SAP transaction for quotation creation consists of multiple input levels and ribbons the Business Integration Appâ€™s user interface is kept as simple as possible. Only the minimum required input fields for quotation creation are provided. It is therefore possible for users without any specific SAP knowledge to create data records which can be processed further by SAP specialists. 


### App structure

The App consists of one single selection screen with a manageable number of input fields. In the main section all fields which are necessary to create a quotation in SAP are listed and in the lower part of the screen material positions can be added to the quotation. Furthermore, there is also the possibility to display already created quotations with a simple search function.

### Create a quotation

To prepare a quotation all mandatory fields have to be filled with data. By clicking a field, the user gets informed if the field is required. 

![ECS-BIA-SAPQuotation2](/img/content/ECS-BIA-SAPQuotation2.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The entries have to be valid values in the SAP system. For some entry boxes there is an input help which can be used to search for specific values like the SAP key or long text.

By using the button *Add new Item* it is possible to add material positions to the quotation. There is also an input help available to search for all customized materials in the SAP system.  

Adding a new item:

It is possible to add multiple positions to the quotation. When all data entries have been made the quotation can be saved with the disk symbol. When you save the quotation the entered data is validated. False entries cannot be saved and an error message is thrown. After successful saving the data is posted to the SAP system into the corresponding tables (e.g. VBAP and VBAK) and databases.
