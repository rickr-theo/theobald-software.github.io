The Services site can be found by default under http://localhost:8085. This page is especially for testing the ECSCore configuration made on the *Management Site*.  

Note that only a local Windows user can be used to connect to the Services site no domain user. 

The *Services Site* can be opened via IIS Manager which is available in your Windows start menu.
Default port is 8080  (http://localhost:8080). You can bookmark the web site in your internet browser then.

You can use the following services:

**Clear caches**

IIS tends to do much Caching to spare CPU on compiling and fetching the page each time. That means, that if you update a setting on Management Site you have to Clear caches to insure effective settings are being propagated to clients.
