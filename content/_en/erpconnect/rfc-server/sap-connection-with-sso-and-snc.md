{% highlight csharp %}
RFCServer rfcServer = new RFCServer();
rfcServer.GatewayHost = "reutlingen";
rfcServer.GatewayService = "sapgw00";
rfcServer.ProgramID = "SNCTEST";
rfcServer.SNCSettings.Enabled = true;
rfcServer.SNCSettings.Mechanism = SNCMechanism.Kerberos5;
rfcServer.SNCSettings.OwnName = "p:RFCServerSNC@THEOBALD";
 
rfcServer.Protocol = ClientProtocol.RFC;
rfcServer.CanReceiveIdocs = true;
rfcServer.IsUnicode = true;

It's important that the partner name in the SAP transaction SM59 (e.g. p:RFCServerSNC@THEOBALD) is the same as the RFCServer.SNCSettings.OwnName.
