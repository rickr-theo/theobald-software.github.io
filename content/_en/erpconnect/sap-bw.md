The following section contains information on how to extract BW data. <br>
The *BW* class was developed to extract data from SAP BW InfoCubes and QueryCubes (also known as BEx Queries).
A common approach for using the *BW* class is to build and extract a BEx query that meets your business requirements.

**Note**: This section refers to BW Queries, for information on queries created by the SAP transactions **SQ02** and **SQ01**, see [SAP Query](./sap-queries).
