### Netweaver DLL
ERPConnect supports the Netweaver RFC (SDK) starting by version 4.6.0.  
To use it, set the Property Protocol of the R3Connection object to ClientProtocol.NWRFC before you open the connection. 

**R3Connection.Protocol = ClientProtocol.NWRFC;**

For 64-Bit Environments the following DLLs are required:
- ERPConnect35.dll or ERPConnect45.dll
- sapnwrfc.dll
- icuucXX.dll
- icudtXX.dll
- icuinXX.dll 

(XX can vary depending on the version of the NW Rfc Libraries)

The ERPConnect*.dll are delivered with ERPConnect. The other DLLs must be downloaded from the SAP web site.
