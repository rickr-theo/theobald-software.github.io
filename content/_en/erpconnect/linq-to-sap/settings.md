**Reuse Classes**

allows the use of the same class (of an RFC-Table or RFC-Structure) in various SAP function modules. 
If two different function modules have e.g. an RFC-table of the same type, 
then both RFC-tables can have the same data type (e.g. RequestTable) and it is not necessary to define two different data types (such as RequestTable and RequestTable1).

**Create Objects Outside Of Context Class**

Classes (such as structures and tables) of an SAP function module can be defined outside the context-class and thus could be used independently of the context class.
