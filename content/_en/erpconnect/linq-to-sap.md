*LINQ to SAP* is an exclusive add-on for ERPConnect that integrates Microsoftâ€™s [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) to provide native data querying capabilities. <br>
The add-on comes with a Designer for more user-friendliness.

**Note:** Due to trademark regulations *LINQ to SAP* is called *LINQ to ERP* in the source code. 

LINQ to SAP is an exclusive add-on for ERPConnect. It builds internally on ERPConnect and does not exist as a stand-alone tool. 
Thus any existing ERPConnect code is always compatible with *LINQ to SAP*.

No other .dlls are needed.

### Technical Prerequisites
