### About the Report Component

The Report component enables data extraction from most standard and custom ABAP reports and SAP transactions. 
In general report extraction is possible if the report returns a table-like structure in SAP. 
This is the case for many Classical or ALV reports such as RLT10010 (Evaluation of Movements per Storage type) or RKEB0601 (Display Line Items).

**Note:** The Report component requires installation of the custom function module `Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT` in your SAP system. For detailed information, see [Install Report Custom Fuction Module](../sap-customizing/install-report-custom-function-module).
